# Ternary
Like JavaScript, C has a ternary operator:
```c
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int max = a > b ? a : b;
printf("max: %d\n", max);
// max: 10
```
Let's break down the syntax:
```c
a > b ? a : b
```
`a > b` is the condition
`?` begins the "then" value
`a` is the final value if the condition is true
`:` separates the "else" value
`b` is the final value if the condition is false
The entire expression (`a > b ? a : b`) evaluates to either `a` or `b`, which is then assigned to `max` in our example.
Ternaries are a way to write a simple if/else statement in one line.
